Joe Santino – jsantino 
Individual Report 2 

1.Next week the work I hope to accomplish is creating a first version of the user manual for the type annotations we are designing so that we have a detailed description of exactly what we need our system to do. Help design the trivial type checker that we will create to solidify our understanding of using the checker framework. Look through other programs and find the situations where arrays are used and out of bounds to find out additional functionality we may want to support. 

2. What I did this week:
•	Found issues with the original plan for the type system, to address this I redesigned our annotations, and how the checker works in general.
•	Based on these changes and feedback from the instructor, rewrote the How it works section of the project plan.
•	Created a user manual for the checker, and a page documenting what code looks like with all annotations, including the ones the user doesn’t have to add manually.
•	Worked with the team to design a trivial type checker that works with our main project.
•	Created ui diagrams to document how the Index Checker is used for our use cases.
•	Wrote up the meeting report for our interaction giving feedback to the other team.
•	Wrote the product overview, features lists, toolset, group dynamics and schedule for the Software Requirements Specification. 
Main problem this week was that we were planning too complex of a system, which we actually had mentioned as a risk. We were trying to keep track of so much information that the checker just would not have worked. We made the plan simpler to just do enough that it can handle the most common usages well.

3. Next Week:
•	Work on the Design Spec
•	Plan the presentation of Index Checker
•	Complete an implementation plan of what we are going to be making for the project.
•	Help with the Trivial Type Checker
